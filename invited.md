**JWST: from launch to Cycle 1 science**

<div style="text-align: justify">
 This contribution will provide a quick overview of the launch and initial phases of JWST, including the series of deployments that will have to be performed before JWST arrives at its second Lagrangian point halo orbit, and the Commissioning activities that will make it ready to enter regular operations and begin execution of the Cycle 1 Science Program 6 months after. I will also provide an overview of the accepted JWST Cycle 1 Science Program, the observations that are expected to revolutionize our understanding of astronomy.
